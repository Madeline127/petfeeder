# petfeeder

My name is Madeline Griffin from Trinity Christian Academy. This project gave me the oportunity to do a lot more than I was previously doing in coding. I got to learn how to use the power tools necessary to make this project as well as learn another coding language that I had no previous experience with. This is a project that will be used in everyday life at home. I have set it up for my dogs to get one full bowl of food once a day, every day, and have set it up in my house so it will feed my pets without the need of human interaction.
