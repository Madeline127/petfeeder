My name is Madeline Griffin from Trinity Christian Academy. This project gave me the oportunity to do a lot more than I was previously doing in coding. I got to learn how to use the power tools necessary to make this project as well as learn another coding language that I had no previous experience with. This is a project that will be used in everyday life at home. I have set it up for my dogs to get one full bowl of food once a day, every day, and have set it up so my mom can control it remotely from her computer in case we need to change any of the code or turn it off for any reason.
